# How easy is it to start with MeteorJS

## first steps
. First of all, install meteor.
It is as easy as:

 curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh

. then clone the current repo

. start meteor from within the project directory

  meteor

## final step: you will participate
This example is a very simple chat application that comes with:

- user authentication
- no security (incecure and autopublish is not removed)
- raw message's timestamp displayed
- no css

### So lets format the timestamp

We are going to use the `momentjs` lib to format the timestamp. To do so, just add the lib:

  meteor add momentjs:moment

then uncomment the `input` template helper section in `main.js`
and let meteor rebuild and *livereload* the changes.

### we can beautify the app by using bootstrap

Very simple to add bootstrap to our application:

  meteor add twbs:bootstrap

## about MeteorJS
### Naming convention

There is no naming convention. You can name your file as you want, Meteor will load them.

### Structuring your files

All files are available from client and server.

`public` folder is for static files.

You can put your frontend files in a `client` folder.

Same way, put your backend only files in a `server`folder.

Otherwise use `Meteor.isClient` and `Meteor.isServer` to isolate execution context.
